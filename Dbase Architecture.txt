	1. My SQL Architecture
		a. Describes components and relationships between components 
		b. Four Layers of SQL Architecture
			i. Tools
				1) Interact with users
				2) Send queries to processors
			ii. Processor
				1) Compiles queries
				2) Manages connections from users
			iii. Storage Engine / Storage Mgr
				1) Executes instructions 
				2) Manage indexes
				3) Interacts with file system
			iv. File System
				1) Access data on storage media
		c. Tools
			i. Connectors / APIs
			ii. Workbench
			iii. Utility Programs
				1) Installation
				2) Client
				3) Admin
				4) Developer
				5) Misc Tools
		d. Query Processor
			i. Manage Connections / Compile Queries
				1) Connection is a link between tools and processor
			ii. Query Parser
				1) Checks for syntactical errors
			iii. Query Optimizer
				1) Selects fastest plan
			iv. Cache Manager
				1) Stores reusable info / transactions ran
		e. Storage Engine
			i. Transaction Mgmt and Data Access
			ii. Buffer manager
				1) Retains data blocks for reuse
					a) Stored in the buffer
					b) Fixed amount of memory
				2) LRU algorithm
					a) Least recently used is out 
			iii. SQL supports nine storage engines
		f. File System
			i. Data stored on storage media
			ii. User Data
				1) Tables / indexes
			iii. Log Files
				1) Sequential record of each change to a database
			iv. Data dictionary
				1) Also a catalog
				2) Directory of database
				3) SQL Data dictionary contains roughly 30 built in tables
	2. Cloud Databases
		a. Infrastructure As a Service
			i. IaaS
				1) Comp processcing, memory and storage media
					a) AWS
			ii. Platform as a Service
				1) PaaS
					a) Tools / Services as databases, app tools and messaging
						i) Azure
			iii. Software as a Service
				1) SAAS
					a) Applications through web browsers
						i) Google Docs, Sheets, etc..
	3. Distributed Databases
